	<h1>Campus Life</h1>
	
	<p>
		During my first year, I involved in a couple clubs. I never was apart of a dance crew until I came to college and joined the Xclusive Step team. That same year, I joined the executive board as publicity chair. This club helped tone my body and required 5 hours of dedication every week. Only being in the club for a year, I now have to work on getting my toned arms back. ðŸ˜” </p>

		The only club that I am apart of on campus currently is the National Society of Black Engineers. I have been in this program since freshman year. Presently, I am on the executive board as the publicity chair. Through attending their yearly spring convention, I have gained opportunities and connections in the tech world. The summer of freshman year, I attended a program with Twitter in San Francisco headquarters where I with five other students created a new tab feature for the social media platform. Then the summer of sophomore year (aka this past summer), I was in Grand Rapids, Michigan, which is a lot like Rochester, to intern as a software engineer at General Electric Aviation.
