	<h1>Internships</h1>
	<p>
		Summer of 2018, I interned at an art organization in New York City called Arts Connection for 9 weeks. There, I was able to gain skills in content management for their social media page and curation skills. I created a project that involved establishing a social media campaign on their Instagram. </p>

		At General Electric, I was doing tests for their Digital Data Transfer Unit which is a device that talks to the pilot on their dashboard. I had to study the behaviors of the unit to create a software copy. I also learned how to fly a plane virtually using software that pilots use. I did all of my work using C# and XML. At the internship, I learned that I did not like aviation or cities without trains. I am working on getting an internship design web apps and/or mobile applications. Wish me luck! : )
