		<h1>College Life</h1>
		<p>My Name is Michael Pearson and I was born and raised in Washington D.C. Ever since I could remember I was always fascinated with technology. It all started playing with legos and growing up playing a bunch of games. Playing the games itself added to my address of technology but the world building inside the games I played were astonishing. For example, Star Wars, Halo, Gears of War, and so many more. I am also big fan of sci fi films which contributed to my passion for technology.
