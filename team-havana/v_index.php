		<h1>Me, in a Nutshell</h1>

		<p>I am currently a sophomore at the University of Rochester pursing a Bachelor’s degree in Language, Media, and Communications (or English, in simpler terms). I’ve essentially spent my entire life in Rochester as I was born and grew up here. After obtaining my Bachelor’s degree, I plan on attending the Warner School of Education here at UR to get a Master’s in Education. My career goal is to become a secondary English teacher, and I would really love to teach at an RCSD school, which is where I attended both elementary and high school. Aside from English, I’m also very interested in Computer Science, Studio Art and Gender Studies, which I have been able to explore more through classes here at UR. </p>
