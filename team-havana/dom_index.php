		Hi! I am Dominique Dorvil. It‚Äôs a pleasure to meet you! ü§óI am born and raised in Brooklyn, New York. I am a junior at the University of Rochester, double majoring in Computer Science and Digital Media Studies. Some of my interests include social media, video editing, digital art, graphic/web/app design and development. This year I am a writing tutor in training, the publicity chair for the National Society of Black Engineers, a TA for a web design course, and in the process of starting a club. I love being able to express myself creatively. I do so by writing and painting. These are my first two loves before I convinced my mom to turn our house into a farm with three fur babies. Outside of class/school, one can find me talking on the phone, watching videos on the intellectual side of YouTube(check out Bobo M), writing in my journal, or binge watching TV (Money Heist, Jane the Virgin, The Bold Type, 13 Reasons Why, Grownish, EUPHORIA üòç), and travelling to other countries. I also spend a lot of time researching conspiracy theories! </p>
