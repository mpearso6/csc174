	<h1>Humble Beginnings</h1>
	
	<p>
		Since I went to an art high school, there was no computer science programs there. I learned about the discipline when I was looking at college and found the major, “Digital Media Studies” at the University of Rochester and saw that was apart of the program. I decided that if I was going to see if DMS was the right major for me, I should explore computer science. So I applied to an organization named, Girls Who Code. I got accepted into their summer cohort in 2015. At Girls Who Code, I found my interest for web design. But I was also introduced to the basics of human computer interaction, robotics, and other topics.  At the University, I took CSC 161(python), 170(web design), 171(java), 172(data structures and algorithms) and DMS 101(media studies), 103(graphic design), 104(user experience design). I am currently taking CSC 173(C programming), 174, and 214(iOS Development/Swift coding). I am also a teacher’s assistant for CSC 170 right now. </p>
